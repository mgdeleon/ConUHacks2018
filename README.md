# InstaStock - ConUHacks2018 submission 
### What it does
An Android app that captures the image of a brand logo through the phone's camera, and then displays the basic stock information like trade price, net change,etc. Additionally, a user can also access the graph of that company with the latest stock prices.

### How we built it
We used the Clarifai API to detect the logo of the company and display it to the user using the Android Studio platform. To get access to all the stock market data, we utilized the AstuceMedia API and render the information in the form of graph.

### Challenges we ran into
Our major problem was the utilization of the stock data and processing it in the accurate way to display the information of the company's stock. Further, since it was our first time using the Clarifai API, we were unsure about how to capture the image of the logo and feed it to process the API request.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had a lot of big tasks that had to be subdivided and make sure each unit works. After the completion of the project, we are proud of implementing everything and more importantly, making sure the app worked as a whole.

### What we learned
We learnt how to make API requests, getting the data as JSON objects and extract relevant information from the data. Also, we took a step forward in debugging Android Studio more effectively.

### What's next for InstaStock
We plan to commercialize the app, and help people deal with financial markets more smartly. We also intend to add more logos of companies, with additional UI features.
